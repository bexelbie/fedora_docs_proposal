= Downstream Notes

== Consuming AsciiBinder Repositories

When downstream contributors wish to consume the documentation for
publishing or private patches/publishing there are several considerations
that should be paid.

Note: I have written this document while thinking about a specific
downstream contributors tooling.  This may not work in all situations.

=== includes

When one AsciiDoc file is included inside of another using an
`include::file.adoc[]` style directive, file resolution can be a problem
with other tools.

This happens because AsciiBinder's opinionation causes it to believe
that all included files should be referenced with full paths relative
to the root directory of the repository.

For comparison, consider this file tree and a desire to include `b.adoc`
inside of `a.adoc`:

```
.
└── title1
    ├── a.adoc
    └── b.adoc
```

When processing the file `a.adoc` with most AsciiDoc tools, for example,
`asciidoctor`, the include statement in `a.adoc` would be written
as follows:

```
\include::b.adoc[]
```

However, because of AsciiBinder's opinionation, when using AsciiBinder, the include directive would be written as follows:

```
\include::title1/b.adoc[]
```

This second form will break many other AsciiDoc processors.

Two, untested, remediation solutions are:

. Develop a pre-processor script which will correct these issues.
   A possible solution would be:
+
```
TITLES="title1
title2
...
titleN"

for title in $TITLES; do
    cd $title
    sed -ie 's/include::$title\//include::/g`
    cd ..
done
```

. In the particular case of this consumer, they process the AsciiDoc
   into a single file for further consumption by their toolchain.
   In order to do this, they have a file, `master.adoc` which includes
   all of the content.
+
They should be able to place the content from the AsciiBinder Repository
in a subdirectory of the `master.adoc` and still have it complete
correctly.  For example:
+
```
.
├── master.adoc
└── title1
    ├── a.adoc
    └── b.adoc
```
+
I believe that most AsciiDoc tools follow a three step file resolution
ruleset:
+
. If the include is a full path, use the path.
. Look in the current directory
. Look in the directory from which the tool was run
+
This third rule should allow for proper file inclusion.

=== images

AsciiBinder's opinionation about images is two fold:

. Images must be in a directory called `images` located in the same
   directory as the including file.
. Images are referred to without any reference to the `images` directory
   in their path.

This tree represents what an AsciiBinder repository looks like if the
files `foo.png` and `bar.png` are used in the files `a.adoc` and `b.adoc`.

```
.
└── title1
    ├── a.adoc
    ├── b.adoc
    └── images
        ├── bar.png
        └── foo.png
```

The image macro would be written as follows:

```
image::foo.png[alt text]
```

This will break many other AsciiDoc processors for similar reasons as
with includes, above.

Two, untested, solutions are:

. Rewrite the image macros
+
```
sed -ie 's/image::/image::images\//g'
```

. Put images into the same directory as the AsciiDoc files like this:
+
```
.
└── title1
    ├── a.adoc
    ├── b.adoc
    ├── bar.png
    └── foo.png
```

=== ifdef globbing

This is the area I have studied the least.

It has been reported to me that AsciiBinder allows `ifdef` evaluations
to use globbing for attribute evaluation.

For example, if you wish to conditionally include some text if either
`attribute1` or `attribute2` is true, you would normally write this:

```
\ifdef::attribute1,attribute2[conditionally included text]
```

Apparently, AsciiBinder supports, but does not require the use of
this syntax:

```
\ifdef::attribute*[conditionally included text]
```

One solution would be to work with upstreams to discourage the use of
this syntax.

Alternately, it should be possible to develop a script that will process
these back into proper AsciiDoc, however, I do not have a code sample.
Algorithmically it seems you would need to:

. Scan the AsciiDoc files for attribute declarations and store all of
   the attribute names.
. Scan the AsciiDoc files for `ifdef[^[]*\*` and then expand the the
   glob with your attribute list.

This looks very fragile because you could accidentally expand the globbing
for conditions it should never have checked for.  This, however, is the
exact reason why this use of globbing is a bad idea and should be avoided.

=== What else?

I don't know.
